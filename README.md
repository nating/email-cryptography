### Paro: _"Someone who is scared and/or paranoid."_

## Overview

Imparo encrypts your emails using the public key of the person you wish to be able to decrypt it. Only they can decrypt the message using their own private key.

Encrypted messages are signed using your private key, so you can be verified as the sender of the message.


## Specification:

```
The App will have:
  A key management system for:
    Sending 'Signed & Enveloped' messages to other users
    Adding & removing users from your secure messaging group
   
The App will be built for a Webmail Client such as Gmail or Apple Mail.
```
