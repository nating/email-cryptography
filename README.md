### Paro: _"Someone who is scared and/or paranoid."_

## Overview

Imparo encrypts your emails using the public key of the person you wish to be able to decrypt it. Only they can decrypt the message using their own private key.

Encrypted messages are signed using your private key, so you can be verified as the sender of the message.

## Set Up

When You get Imparo, you should go onto the [options page](chrome-extension://flhloomlgckkflmlkklmcfjjgmkkcfjg/options.html) to generate your public/private key pair.  

Here you can also add your contacts and their public keys so you can encrypt messages especially for them.
